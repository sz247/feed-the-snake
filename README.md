# feed-the-snake

C++ implementation of the snake game. 

The user can use keys ‘a’, ‘d’, ‘w’ and ‘s’ to move the snake left, right, up and down respectively and feed the snake with the food which is randomly generated to grow the tail of the snake. Each time the snake (Ooo) feeds on the food (F) the tail size increases and score increases by 10 and the game ends if the snake hits itself with the tail.
